# Optimus

Optimus is an advanced tool designed to simplify the process of selecting and dimensioning three-phase transformers. Whether for industrial or residential applications, Optimus offers a comprehensive solution to quickly obtain precise specifications for your transformer needs.

## Features

- **Detailed Specifications**: Obtain detailed results on the characteristics of the dimensioned transformer, including rated power, short-circuit currents, power losses, and efficiency.
- **Comparison of Options**: Compare multiple configurations of three-phase transformers to find the best solution in terms of cost, efficiency, and performance.
- **Automated Calculations**: Reduce the time required for transformer dimensioning with automated calculations and instant results.
- **Precision**: Get accurate specifications and design recommendations based on advanced algorithms.
- **Flexibility**: Easily adjust transformer parameters to meet the specific needs of your application.
- **Cost Optimization**: Optimize the design to minimize initial and operational costs through better energy efficiency.

## Types of Calculations

Optimus performs a variety of essential calculations for three-phase transformer design, including:
- All types of losses and efficiency
- Geometric dimensions
- Weight of the magnetic circuit
- Currents and voltages

## Future Development

Optimus is continually evolving. Currently, it validates the performance of three-phase transformers. Future updates will include:
- Simulation of no-load and short-circuit tests
- Libraries of materials
- 3D modeling tools
